					<h2>Adequate heat up miserable New Year’s Eve with a whole lot of funk.</h2>	
					<p class="small-text"><i>Wednesday, 10 January 2018 16:54</i></p>
					<p>Adequate and Ben Price magic were just the trick to heat up New Year’s Eve at the Owl Acoustic Lounge Dec. 31.</p>
					<p class="part2">


 Adequate was well underway when I arrived around 9 p.m.<br>


 They played their usual exuberant, funk fuelled, toe tapping set of R and B and soul music, and as usual, looked like they stepped through the smoke on stage right from the ’70s. And even though it was -32 in the shade, Adequate bassist Scott Mezei showed he was  in a summer kind of mood by wearing shorts.<br><br>


 Drummer Keenan Pezderic sang most of the soulful number including an excellent version of Dr. John’s “Right place, Wrong Time,” though guitarist Josh Thorlakson sang “I’ve Got Sunshine.”<br><br>


Mezei added the third harmony for “My Girl.”</p>

					<h2>The show goes on for Papa King despite semi rollover and chilly New Year‘s Ever</h2>
					<p class="small-text"><i>Wednesday, 10 January 2018 16:36</i></p>
					<p>Local bluesman Papa King Cole is a real trooper. Even though he was in a semi rollover the night before from which he escaped relatively unscathed, the New Year’s Eve show went on at the Slice, Dec. 31.</p>
					<p class="part_2">Understandably, King played the show sitting down, but still managed to kill it, singing the blues in his gravelly voice, passing most solo duties to Papa King playing the Slice for New Year’s Eve. Photo by Richard Amery


keyboardist Earl McAuley. Doug Freeman played groovy bass.


 They eased into the evening with one of my favourite King originals “Beale Street  Blues,” which King began solo before being joined by Freeman on bass.


 He followed it up with a solid set of original and traditional blues songs including another one of my favourite “Sugar Babe.”


He brought out the slide for a couple more Delta blues numbers. I enjoyed  “Going Down to memphis,” and “Mellow Down Easy.”</p>
